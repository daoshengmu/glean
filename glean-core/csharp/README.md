# Glean SDK C# Binding
Glean C# binding gives the ability to C# applications to integrate with Glean SDK.

## System Requirement
I only tested my C# projects on Windows. All you need is.

- Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 or above.

## Usage
- Use MSVC to open `demo.sln` from *glean-core/csharp*. In MSVC, switching **Solution Platforms** to **x64**, **Startup Projects** to **demo**.
- Choose *Build->Build Solution* from the top menu, then clicking ▶️ Start.

## File Description
- **Built-in metric files**: I copied built-in metrics.yaml and pings.yaml from Glean-Python package to *glean-core/csharp/demo/demo/bin/x64/Debug*.
- **glean_ffi.dll**: It was copied from Glean-Python package to *glean-core/csharp/demo/demo/bin/x64/Debug*.
- **Custom metric files**: I created them at *glean-core/csharp/demo/demo/bin/x64/Debug*, they will be loaded in *glean-core/csharp/demo/demo/Program.cs*.
- **glean.dll**: It is generated by glean.csprj from *glean-core/csharp/glean*, and it will be copied automatically to the executable file folder.
